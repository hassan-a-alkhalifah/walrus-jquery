#### _A hide and show project_

#### By _**Hassan Al-khalifah & Hingyi Khong**_

## Description

_This website is a basic pee-ka-boo game. You click a paragraph and it displays an image. You click the images and it hides it. The webpage was worked on as a way for me to practice jQuery toggle methods and manipulating the DOM with JavaScript_

## Setup/Installation Instructions

*_Make sure you have Git downloaded and setup on your local device._

*_Open terminal on your local device._

*_If you have not configured Git on your local device, in the terminal, you will need to set up a global configuration by entering the following:_

```
_git config --global user.name "Your first and last name"_

git config --global user.email example@gmail.com_
```
*_If you're not already in the desktop directory in your terminal, then direct yourself to the desktop directory by entering the follow in your terminal:_

`_cd Desktop_`

*_You can now begin by cloning the GitHub remote repository to your desktop. On the GitHub website with the remote GitHub repository, you will find a button colored green with the text "Clone or Download." Click the button and copy the GitHub repository URL._

*_Now in your terminal, enter the following:_

`_git clone "the GitHub repository URL you copied"_` without the quotes

*_Now your desktop should have a local copy of the cloned repository._

*_To view the webpage, in your terminal, enter the following:_
